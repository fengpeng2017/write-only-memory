This driver implements a driver for the signetics 25120 WRITE ONLY MEMORY.

Once the module is loaded, create a /dev-node with:
$ mknod /dev/wom c XXX 0
To get the correct value for XXX see `dmesg`

Applications:
	* don't care buffer stores
	* least significant control memories
	* post mortem memories (weapon systems)
	* artificial memory stores
	* non-intelligent micro controllers
	* first-in never-out (fino) asynchronous buffer
	* overflow register (bit bucket)

Tested on:
	* developed on 2.6.x
	* works on 4.11.x
